## Project Overview
This repository documents my progression through Git version control exercises. It contains multiple "Lab" workspaces demonstrating branching, merging, conflict resolution, and web development basics.

### Project Structure
| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **lab1/** | Initial HTML setup and root project files. |
| **lab2/** | Content experiments (`JK.txt`, `menu.txt`). |
| **lab3/** | API configuration and menu data. |
| **lab4/** | Base templates for the web project. |
| **lab5/** | **"Coffee Heaven"**: The main website implementation (renamed from generic shop). |
| **lab6/** | **Styling**: CSS experiments (`style.css`) and font adjustments. |
